# Stochastic Modelling of Virus Population Dynamics

This is a project I completed while taking "MITx: 6.00.2x Intro to Computational Thinking and Data Science" on Edx. The purpose of this project is to allow students to design and implement a stochastic simulation of patient and virus population dynamics, and reach conclusions about treatment regimens based on the simulation results.

The python codes I wrote are in ps3b.py, and an overview of this simulation is provided in Background of Models.pdf .
