## Stochastic Modelling of Virus Population Dynamics

In this course project I designed and implemented a stochastic simulation of patient and virus population dynamics. I then inferred treatment regimens from the simulation results.

The python codes I wrote are in ps3b.py, and an overview of this simulation is provided in Background of Models.pdf .
